Description: Provides functions to calculate the log-likelihood function, score 
  function and observed information matrix for extreme value models even in 
  cases where the shape parameter is very close to zero.  If the shape 
  parameter is close enough to zero direct evaluation of some of the quantities 
  involved can be unreliable. In these cases, these quantities are expressed as 
  a series expansion, whose value is approximated using the 'sumR' package 
  <https://cran.r-project.org/package=sumR>.
