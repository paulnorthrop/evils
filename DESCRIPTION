Description: Provides functions to calculate contributions to the 
  log-likelihood function, score function and observed information matrix from
  individuals observations for the Generalised Extreme Value and Generalised 
  Pareto extreme value models. If the shape parameter is close enough to zero, 
  direct evaluation of some of the quantities involved can be unreliable. In 
  these cases, the problematic terms involve log(1+x)/x and/or the first and 
  second derivatives of this function. Functions are provided to evaluate these 
  quantities reliably when x is close to 0.
