## Evaluate Extreme Value Likelihoods Safely

Provides functions to calculate contributions to the log-likelihood function, score function and observed information matrix from individuals observations for the GEV and GP extreme value models. If the shape parameter is close enough to zero, direct evaluation of some of the quantities involved can be unreliable. In these cases, the problematic terms involve log(1+x)/x and/or the first and second derivatives of thisfunction. Functions are provided to evaluate these quantities reliably when x is close to 0.
